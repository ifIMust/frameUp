Examples of how to build the tests:
gcc test_pkt_queue.c pkt_queue_private.c pkt_private.c -o test_pkt_queue -pthread
gcc test_pkt.c pkt_private.c -o test_pkt

Each test binary returns 0 if successful, and non-zero if one or more tests failed.

Assumptions:
- pkt_queue_destroy will not be called while any blocking queue operations are in progress.
- pkt_queue_close disallows further writes.
- If a packet exceeds the maximum permitted length, it will be dropped.
- Any 0x02 byte found in a byte stream will cause a new packet to be started immediately, and all previous state to be dropped (even after a 0x10).
