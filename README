// TODOs
- Disallow writes to the queue when it is closed(?)
- Use condvars in the test cases to guarantee sequence and remove sleep
- Handle a packet that is too long (drop)

Assumptions:
- pkt_queue_destroy will not be called while any blocking queue operations are in progress.
- pkt_queue_close disallows further writes.
- If a packet exceeds the maximum permitted length, it will be dropped.
